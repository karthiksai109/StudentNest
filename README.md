# StudentNest

A complete settlement guide for international students moving to a new country for studies.

## What It Does

StudentNest helps international students find everything they need when arriving at a new city for college:

- **Affordable Housing** — Verified apartments and rooms near campus with real pricing, reviews, and direct landlord contacts
- **Home Food & Groceries** — Restaurants and grocery stores serving your national cuisine, with student discounts
- **Community Groups** — Connect with students from your country, join cultural events and festivals
- **Sports & Activities** — Find pickup games, sports leagues, and fitness groups near campus

## How It Works

1. Register with your name, email, college, and nationality
2. The app searches for all nearby options based on your college location
3. Browse housing, food, communities, and sports — all with reviews and contact info
4. Connect with landlords, join groups, and settle in
